Right so Imma make a C interpreter.
Hardest part is gonna be functions I gather, since Imma have to put all the params in place and only then call the func, and that's gonna require some heavy-ish asm.

And as I start to code this, I realize the grotesque task that's ahead of me. So I've decided I'm just gonna do basic functionality first, and then maybe go over to bla bla bla.

Right so I did a lot of non-blog worthy attempts yesterday, and I've worken up with some more clairty.

The way this has to work is as a pipeline.

What do I mean by pipeline? Simple. if we have ``float a = (float)1 + 3 / 2;``, the first thing we gotta do is:

1. create a float value a and set it to the current scope
2. aknowledge the float cast on the 1
3. do the division of 3 by 2, where 3 defaults to integer, so the division will result in 1
4. do the sum, which requires converting the previous 1 to float, and adding it to the casted one.
5. assign the result to a
