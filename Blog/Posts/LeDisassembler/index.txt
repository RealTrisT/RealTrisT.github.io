[h20][<~What~>]

A disassembler, that is fully modular and displays as much data as possible.


[h20][<~Why~>]

I've needed to make a disassembler for a while now, because of multiple projects that I've worked on where one would have come in quite handy.

There's already capstone and shit, but I want to learn as much as possible about the x86 architecture because it genuinely interests me, and what better way of doing that than coding a disassembler.

With the power of a disassembler I coded myself, I will become a god of the binary.
