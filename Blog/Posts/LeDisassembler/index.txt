[__TITLE__][<~Project: LeDisassembler~>]

[h20][<~What~>]

A disassembler, that is fully modular and displays as much data as possible.


[h20][<~Why~>]

I've needed to make a disassembler for a while now, because of multiple projects that I've worked on where one would have come in quite handy. (for example the section extender, that had to become a section appender)

There's already capstone and shit, but I want to learn as much as possible about the x86 architecture because it genuinely interests me, and what better way of doing that than coding a disassembler.

With the power of a disassembler I coded myself, I will become a god of the binary.

[h20][<~It.~>]


So this is important since this is how an instruction works.

[img src="https://imgur.com/Iqvwqk1.png"]

I've sorta read on this a bit before, and I remember there were a fixed set of instruction prefixes, so might start from there.

Got 600 pages to read, so ye.

Right so first things first, how the thing's gonna be.
I'm thinking making a structure and having some flags to indicate the operands, variable for size etc..
Generally just all the useful information so one is able to get the original opcode from the struct, as well as useful info.

So. ``Opcode.h`` is on it's way.

Since I'm not just making a size calculator I think I might make private members for instruction prefixes, opcode, modR/M, etc..




[h6][<~Instruction prefixes~>]


So instruction prefixes are 1 byte each, and multiple can be used, so I think Imma make it a flag.

There are 4 groups:
-Lock/Repeat
-Segment Override
-Operand-size Override
-Address-Size Override

The last 2 are just one thing each, 0x66 or 0x67 respectively. Somewhat self explanatory.
The first two aren't so simple, with different prefixes for different situations, and different uses for the same prefix depending on context.

More info on this is on page 36, I'd advise skipping the bulletpoints.



[h6][<~Opcodes~>]

Oh boy, this is the hadpat.

The main takeaway is this: ```txt
A primary opcode can be 1, 2, or 3 bytes in length. An additional 3-bit opcode field is sometimes encoded in the ModR/M byte.
```
Two-byte opcode formats for general-purpose and SIMD (Single instruction, multiple data) instructions consist of a 0x0F (an escape code as the primary opcode, not to be confused with LOCK prefix's 0xF0) and an second opcode byte, and "optionally" a mandatory prefix in the beginning of all that (0x66, 0xF2 or 0xF3).
[h2][<~"optionally" cuz it has to be there for some opcodes, and not for others~>]

Three-byte opcodes for general-purpose and SIMD instructions are basically the same but instead of one additional opcode byte, it has two.

So basically we know that if second byte is 0x0F, chances are the first is a mandatory prefix.

Tho honestly, I'd advise reading 2.1.2, it's highly informative. But read it real slow, you get 1 letter or 1 comma wrong and you'll be confused senseless. Or maybe it's just me.



[h6][<~ModR/M~>]

So the main takeaway is this:
```txt
Many instructions that refer to an operand in memory have an addressing-form specifier byte (called the ModR/M byte) following the primary opcode.
```
Let's first start by reminding ourselves of the pic above.

It was highly useful for me, since back when I tried looking into this the first time, the ModR/M byte was a complete monster to me, that I really couldn't understand.

Bot now it's broken down([h2][<~aren't monospace fonts great~>]):
```txt
  7 6    5   4   3   2 1 0
| Mod | Reg/Opcode | R / M |
```
This is the 2.1.3 section, and I really don't think I can explain it any better than it is.

The mod and r/m fields come together to form 32 possible values (2^(power of)5 = 32), that is 8 registers, and 24 addressing modes.

The reg/opcode, is exactly that. Either a register, or the rest of the opcode information. That is determined by the primary opcode itself.

The r/m field can specify a register as an operand or along with the mod field, it can be an addressing mode. Sometimes, it's combination with the mod field is used to express opcode info for some instructions. Dunno.



[h6][<~SIB~>]

Some encodings of the ModR/M byte require the extra addressing byte SIB.

For example the base-plus-index and scale-plus-index forms of 32-bit addressing require the SIB.

SIB has the fields scale, index, and base.



[h6][<~Displacement/Immediate~>]

```txt
Some addressing forms include a displacement immediately following the ModR/M byte (or the SIB byte if one is
present). If a displacement is required, it can be 1, 2, or 4 bytes.
If an instruction specifies an immediate operand, the operand always follows any displacement bytes. An immediate
operand can be 1, 2 or 4 bytes.
```
Basically displacement is relative address and immediate is value (I think rn, might be wrong).



[h6][<~Addressing-Mode Encoding of ModR/M and SIB Bytes~>]

So this is a massive shit-tone of text, give me a sec. xd.

Ok, so the main takeaway are these tables:
[img src="https://imgur.com/8DsvAXZ.png"]
[img src="https://imgur.com/ueZuW61.png"]
[img src="https://imgur.com/DPOtyhM.png"]

There are 3 tables, first for 16-bit addressing, second for 32, and third for SID stuff.

Provided we're in 32, the first table will only come in handy when the opcode is preceeded by the Address-Size Override prefix.


[h5][<~Example:~>]

Opcode ``67 89 10``

67: Address-Size Override prefix
89: Opcode mov(where the 2nd operand is the default addressing mode (32 in this case))
10: ModR/M, that if we check on the table, we can see first operand is [bx+si], and second el/ex/edx. Which it is gonna depend on the opcode.

Now if we check an [__LINK="http://ref.x86asm.net/coder32.html"][<~opcode table~>]:
[img src="https://imgur.com/jJvrh7y.png"]

We'll see that the second operand is a register, either 16 or 32, and since default addressing mode is 32, we'll get edx.

The first operand doesn't matter since we've already got everything from ModR/M, so finally, we get:

``mov [bx+si], edx``


[h5][<~Example 2:~>]

Opcode ``67 66 89 10``

It's basically the same as the previous example, but has that 66 there.
That changes the addressing mode, and since current is 32, it'll become 16.
So, the 16 bit variant of edx is dx.

So since that's the only difference, and as we saw in the last image, the second operand depended on the addressing mode, we should this time get:

``mov [bx+si], dx``



[h6][<~Opcode Overview~>]

So, now I've gotten around to experimenting with this stuff, add I've tried starting an implementation of some of it, a few problems arose.

There are 4 different types of opcodes:
-The ones that are fixed, will always be all the same, and either have no operands, or they're defined in full by the ModR/M byte and the opcode itself.
-The ones that will change depending on the register.
-The ones that will always have the same primary offset, but will change based on the Register/Opcode field.


A good example of the first is the ``ADD``(0x0-0x5), different opcodes for different operand types. Operands are then defined by the ModR/M byte (0x0-0x3), or implicit in the opcode itself(0x4-0x5).


Second can be for example ``INC``, ``DEC``, ``PUSH``, or ``POP``, where the base opcode is 0xXYZ, and the opcode for it's corresponding register will be ``0xXYZ + RegisterNumber``.
Register numbers go as follows:
```c
#define REG_NR_EAX 0x0
#define REG_NR_ECX 0x1
#define REG_NR_EDX 0x2
#define REG_NR_EBX 0x3
#define REG_NR_ESP 0x4
#define REG_NR_EBP 0x5
#define REG_NR_ESI 0x6
#define REG_NR_EDI 0x7
```

Third, can be for example the instructions 0x80-0x83, where it can be an ``ADD``, ``OR``, ``ADC``, ``SBB``, ``AND``, ``SUB``, ``XOR``, or ``CMP``, depending on the Register/Opcode field.

So if R/O is 3 bits, that leaves ``2 ^(power of) 3 = 8`` possibilities, as we can count ^upthere.

So for example provided we want to do ``sub register, number`` for 8bit, we'll use 0x80 since that's the one that deals with 8bits, we'll also make sure the Register/Opcode field is 5 to "select" sub, and then Mod and R/M will tell which register to use.

For 32 bit addressing mode it'll be according to the above table (I'll place it here again for visualization's sake):

[h20][<~Implementation~>]


So, since the ModRM byte is so important, we need a decent way to access it, I came up with this:
```cpp
union ModRMByte{
	unsigned char Byte = 0;
	struct RegOpcByte_Bitfield { unsigned char RM : 3, RegOpc : 3, Mod : 2; } Byte_Bitfield;
	//mind the retarded bitfield endianness
};
```If you don't know how a union works, you should prob go read about it, but basically it shares the same memory across the variables you put in it. 

Good for polymorphism, i.e. if in a class you wanna have an int but in another a float you can use it to not waste space, but you can use it this way as well. I often do it for pointers to structures that can be different so no casts are needed (mostly the PE 64 vs 32 stuff).


So, as far as I can tell, it all just boils down seeing what the opcode asks for, and then correctly reading the ModR/M byte if one must be present to meet the necessities of the opcode, taking into account the prefixes.

So, first I needed a list of opcodes and the way they work, so I went [__LINK="http://ref.x86asm.net/geek32.html"][<~here~>], made a little very shitty js script to get the code:

```js
PrefixCell = 0;
Esc0FCell = 1;
OpcodeCell = 2;
RegOpcCell = 4;
NameCell = 11;
Operand1Cell = 12;
Operand2Cell = 13;
Operand3Cell = 14;
Operand4Cell = 15;

var table = document.getElementById("gay"); //whatever ID you give the first table, since it doesn't have one from the get go
var streng = "";
var index = 0;
for (var i = 1, row; row = table.rows[i]; i++) {
	var celloffset = (row.cells[OpcodeCell].colSpan==2?1:0); 
	//1 if colspan is 2    meaning it's a register-added opcode

	if(row.cells[NameCell-celloffset] == null || row.cells[NameCell-celloffset].innerHTML == "<i>no mnemonic</i>" || row.cells[NameCell-celloffset].innerHTML == "<i>undefined</i>")continue;
	//^rule out the trash

	var temp = "/*" + String(index).padStart(3) + "*/    {";
	//current opcode, and put the index in front

	temp += "\"" + row.cells[NameCell-celloffset].innerHTML.replace(/<a.*a>/, "").replace(/^\n/, "").replace(/\n.*/, "").replace(/ /g, "") + "\""; 
	//the name of the opcode

	temp += ", ";
	if(row.cells[RegOpcCell].innerHTML == "")temp+="fld_n";
	else temp += "\"" + row.cells[RegOpcCell].innerHTML + "\"";
	//get the flags in order

	temp += ", ";
	if(row.cells[RegOpcCell].innerHTML == ""){
		temp += "OPCODE_REGOPC_NONE";
	}else{
		temp += (row.cells[RegOpcCell].innerHTML == "r")?"OPCODE_REGOPC_REGISTERS":"OPCODE_REGOPC_EXTENSION";
	}
	//get the regopc in order

	if(row.cells[Operand4Cell - celloffset].innerHTML.indexOf("...") != -1) temp += ", 0, 0, 0, 0";
	else{
		temp +=
		((row.cells[Operand1Cell - celloffset].innerHTML == "") ? (", 0") : (", \"" + row.cells[Operand1Cell - celloffset].innerHTML.replace(/16\/32/ , "16_32").replace(/\//g, "").replace(/(?:<b>|<_b>|<i>|<_i>|<span.*?>)/g, "")) + "\"") +
		((row.cells[Operand2Cell - celloffset].innerHTML == "") ? (", 0") : (", \"" + row.cells[Operand2Cell - celloffset].innerHTML.replace(/16\/32/ , "16_32").replace(/\//g, "").replace(/(?:<b>|<_b>|<i>|<_i>|<span.*?>)/g, "")) + "\"") +
		((row.cells[Operand3Cell - celloffset].innerHTML == "") ? (", 0") : (", \"" + row.cells[Operand3Cell - celloffset].innerHTML.replace(/16\/32/ , "16_32").replace(/\//g, "").replace(/(?:<b>|<_b>|<i>|<_i>|<span.*?>)/g, "")) + "\"") +

	}
	//get the operands in order
	
	temp += "},";
	//end current opcode


	temp = temp.padEnd(140);
	temp += "//" + ((row.cells[0].innerHTML == "") ? "" : "[" + row.cells[0].innerHTML + "] ") + 
		((row.cells[1].innerHTML == "") ? "" : row.cells[1].innerHTML + " ") + 
		((row.cells[2].innerHTML == "") ? "" : "{" + row.cells[2].innerHTML + "} ") + 
		((row.cells[3].innerHTML == "") ? "" : row.cells[3].innerHTML + " ") + 
		((row.cells[4].innerHTML == "") ? "" : "<" + row.cells[4].innerHTML + ">") + 
		((row.cells[5].innerHTML == "") ? "" : "«" + row.cells[5].innerHTML + "»") + "\n";
	//some more info always useful

	index++;
	//some more index

	streng += temp; //append to motha streng
}
console.log(streng.replace(/(?:<b>|<_b>|<i>|<_i>|<\/i>|<b>|<\/b>)/g, "").replace(/:/g, "or"));
```

Some of the code is still from me trying to get the ``coder`` version, which you absolutely shouldn't do for it's ambiguous, get the ``geek`` one instead (the linked one).

Then I also made a second script, to make a second array that would contain the fixed operands. So that you can access the first array with the information as ``OpcodePtrs[Opcode]`` where opcode is the actual opcode byte, which is much, much faster than a massive switch table.

Here's the second shitty script:

```js
OpcodeCell = 2;
NameCell = 11;

var table = document.getElementById("gay"); //whatever ID you give the first table, since it doesn't have one from the get go
var streng = "";

var tableindex = 0;

var index = 0;
var nextopc = 1;
var currentopc = 0;

var wasrepeating = false;

for (var i = 1, row; row = table.rows[i], table.rows[(i+1)]; i++) {

	var celloffset = (row.cells[OpcodeCell].colSpan==2?1:0);
	if(row.cells[NameCell-celloffset] == null || row.cells[NameCell-celloffset].innerHTML == "<i>no mnemonic</i>" || row.cells[NameCell-celloffset].innerHTML == "<i>undefined</i>"){
		if(row.class == "nbb")wasrepeating = false;
		continue;
	}

	currentopc = parseInt(((row.cells[OpcodeCell].innerHTML == "") ? row.cells[0].innerHTML : row.cells[OpcodeCell].innerHTML), 16);
	nextopc = parseInt(((table.rows[(i+1)].cells[OpcodeCell].innerHTML == "") ? table.rows[(i+1)].cells[0].innerHTML : table.rows[(i+1)].cells[OpcodeCell].innerHTML), 16);

	if(currentopc < nextopc){
		if(wasrepeating){
			wasrepeating = false;
		}else{
			if(currentopc + 1 == lastopc){
				streng += "/*" + currentopc.toString(16) + "*/    &opcodeArray[" + tableindex + "],\n";
				index++;
			}else{
				for (var l = 0; l < nextopc - currentopc; l++) {
					streng += "/*" + (currentopc+l).toString(16) + "*/    &opcodeArray[" + tableindex + "],\n"
					index++;
				}
			}
		}
	}else{
		if(!wasrepeating){
			wasrepeating = true;
			streng += "/*" + currentopc.toString(16) + "*/    &opcodeArray[" + tableindex + "],\n";
			index++;
		}
	}

	tableindex++;
	lastopc = currentopc;
}
console.log(streng.replace(/(?:<b>|<_b>|<i>|<_i>|<\/i>|<b>|<\/b>)/g, "").replace(/:/g, "or"));
```
I just copy pasted the first and changed it without paying much attention. If you're looking for my merit in these scripts you won't find it.

Something to think about:
Optimization of switch tables through the creation code pointer arrays and jumping to those. Might look into that in the futcha.



Right now I'm only going for the non-0F-escaped ones, so the second part might come later, might not.

So after I should make an array of pointers to this list, so getting an opcode is just for example ``array[opcode]->name``.
If I was doing 0F-escaped opcodes, it'd be as simple, just ``if(*opcode == 0x0F)blabla = array_escaped[*(opcode+1)]->name``.

Of course some of the entries will be zero, such as 0F itself, or 66/67. So we'll have to account for those later.
