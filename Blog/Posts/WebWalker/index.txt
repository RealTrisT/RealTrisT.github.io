[h20][<~What~>]
A tool for doing what I call web walking, you could call it maybe like id incrementation? idk
Point is you provide a config file with the url and where to replace the id, initial id, and regexes, and it starts shitting stuff out.

This isn't something I've put effort into, initially did it for piratebay.

The [__LINK="https://gist.github.com/RealTrisT/d2598728c0be0c7fc5dfb6574859c9d6#file-walker-py"][<~c0d3nz~>] is hea.


[h20][<~Working~>]

So, as a param, you provide a config file like this:

Then in the script there are 3 functions you might wanna change:

-``consolePrintResults``

-``filePrintResults``

-``handleRequestData``



I think they're pretty self explanatory. If you don't you can go and read the comments on them.

So ye I actually made it for dumping piratebay, so here's the result:

[h2][<~That 529 is a ``too many requests`` error status.~>]


The file will look like this:

It has ``b``s there for some reason, and unicode characters get converted to \xbullshit. idk why cuz I don't deal with encoding.
I don't rly even need to for what I'm doing, in case you're thinking "this sloppy motherfucker". (I am pretty sloppy tho kappa)
Again, you'll prob wanna change that function.

So ye that's about it bye.
