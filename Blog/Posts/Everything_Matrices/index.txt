[h20][<~Wat?~>]

Matrices. This post originated from my deep dive into graphics.
I had previously had an experience with graphics, as you may be able to see in my 
Xaos project (as of writing this post, that's been and will continue to be on hold 
for a long while).

So this post is fairly confusing to write, because I don't know how much to assume
the reader already knows. The post's about a complex-ish topic of the whole graphics
shit that's out there.

So I'll start off with a brief breakdown of rasterization.



[h20][<~Rasterization?~>]

I'm sure you've heard about ray tracing. This is exactly not that.

This is raytracing: 
[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/raytracing.jpg"]

And it produces some really beautiful shit like this:
[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/raytracing_beautiful.jpg"]


[h5][<~But that's not it~>]

Raytacing (sorta) tries to simulate light bounces, refractions, reflections, etc.. That's 
why you get such realistic and beautiful renders with it.
But like with all good things, there are enough problems associated with that. 
Most of it stems from the fact that you can't simulate every photon, but also from 
other generally unfeisable things. For instance it's nearly impossible to have a rainbow 
because you'd have to simulate every water particle in the atmosphere, as well as diffractions
(which are usually neglected regardless due to their little effect in the final product). 

I digress.

Our problem is that it's slow.

It won't run on your PC, it won't run on your phone, it won't run. It'll only crawl.
Very, very slowly.
But good news, once upon a time someone found a different solution that's also fairly
decent at displaying a 3D environment. And one that is computationally efficient.


[h5][<~Rasterization.~>]
[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/rasterization.jpg"]
I started the rasterization section with explaining raytracing because I find it's the
most intuitive approach, as it simulates the real world. I suppose to show that not all
ideas are complicated algorithms designed from the get-go just so computers can do it.
Rasterization is, but it's fairly simple as well.

Consider the triangle above.
It's 2D. It has 3 vertices. You can easily determine whether any point in space is inside
it. You can use it to build any and all other shapes.

[h4][<~Your screen~>] is made up of a finite amount of pixels. Each of those pixels has a
location. Rasterization is just the process of grabbing this 2D triangle's vertices, and
then figuring out which pixels should be turned on in your screen in order to show that
triangle.

People have developed a lot of very smart techniques to build this up into the beautiful
works of art called videogames you see today:
[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/crysis_gameplay_wppr.jpg"]
You might think this looks just as good as raytacing, and god fucking damn it this looks 
so good. But if after this post you still feel like going down this rabbit hole, you'll 
find they just found very smart ways to avoid things that would look bad with rasterization.


So yeah. Rasterization is just grabbing all these triangles, and punching their souls into the 
screen. In the form of pixels. This isn't particularly hard if you think only 2D, but once you
start trying to get 3D things to go on your screen (like that beautiful crysis screenshot),
things start to get a little more complicated.



[h20][<~Linear algebra yesn't?~>]

Well yes, but actually no.

Look, this is gonna have some math on it.
I'm complete shit at math though, so I figure that if I can get it, anyone can.


[h6][<~What we have~>]

We have triangles. To be more precise, we have vertices that will at some point 
make up those triangles. We do not care about the concept of a triangle, because 
that's the job of the rasterizer.

We have a graphics card (GPU aka Graphics Processing Unit), and graphics cards,
unlike your processor (CPU) have a [__BOLD][<~lot~>] of cores. This is in order to be able
to preform tasks in parallel.

[h2][<~So while your CPU is great at doing few hard tasks, your GPU is great at 
doing a whole fuckload of easy tasks. A graphics card can be seen as a whole smaller 
computer. It has advantages in these operations over the CPU because for instance it 
has it's "RAM" (called VRAM) closer by than the CPU has it's (actual) RAM. A graphics 
card would ofc be no good at doing things like parsing the html in this post. The 
html is just a big string that you have to process sequentially, and the CPU's fast 
cores are much better equipped for dealing with something like that. As many cores as 
the GPU may have, it could never deal with that situation well because this process 
can't be broken up into smaller parts, and one core of the GPU is generally much weaker. 
The opposite ends up happening for the CPU in the opposite scenario. All there is to it 
is that we have dedicated hardware, and this takes a lot of the workload off the CPU, 
and gives it to the GPU, which was designed specifically to deal with it.~>]

You'll see later we'll have to perform operations on every single vertex, and for this
the parallel power the GPU has comes in handy.


[h6][<~What we want~>]

What we need to do is grab these vertices, and present them to the rasterizer in 
a way it can understand what needs to be seen. Now, the development of graphics,
like any other industry, developed it's own standards, and has generally headed
in the direction that allows the most flexibility with the most performance and
functionality.

So the way any rasterizer (that actually matters) works is it takes the X and Y 
coordinates from the (-1, -1) to (1, 1) range, maps that to your ``viewport``'s resolution.
The ``viewport`` is just what you're rendering to. It can be your whole screen if
you're running a fullscreen application, a window if not, maybe even your VR headset.

So what we want is to get our supposed-to-be-on-screen 3D points, and get their
X and Y coordinate to be in the -1 to 1 range. Note: the same goes for the Z
coordinate, which is going to end up representing the depth (it'll come in handy
before we're done putting the pixels on the screen).


[h6][<~How we achieve it~>]

With simple math!
You know how pretty much everything in math derives from a sum? The subtraction
operation is inherent to the sum, but the multiplication comes from the sum.
After the multiplication people found out that should have an opposite as well
and so they made up division. It just went up from there to the clusterfuck we
today get to call math.

All this will be exclusively making use of multiplication. Matrix multiplication,
granted, but that's still just sums and multiplications.



[h20][<~Matrix?~>]
[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/matrix.jpg"]

You can see matrices as arrays.
A 4 by 4 (4x4) matrix is just the same as a multidimensional (2-dimensional) array
with 4 columns and 4 rows. Something like this:
```
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
```
Unfortunately though, whoever came up with the mathematical notation was a complete
retard, and the first number actually dictates the number of rows.
This means that a 1x4 matrix is actually:
```
0 0 0 0
```instead of
```
0
0
0
0
```Whatever, it's not overly important.
Also keep in mind that a matrix that has the same number of columns as it has rows
is called a [__BOLD][<~square~>] matrix.


[h6][<~Transpose~>]
[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/matrix_pills.jpg"]

The transpose of the matrix is just the matrix flipped over it's diagonal.

Example 1:
```
1 1 1
```transpose:
```
1
1
1
```
Example 2:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```transpose:
```
1 4 7
2 5 8
3 6 9
```
This is slightly important, because if you're in the process of getting 
into graphics and you really do want to understand matrices, you might 
see elsewhere values changing in different places of the matrices.

Just keep in mind that ``transpose(m1*m2) == transpose(m1)*transpose(m2)``.
That should explain it, meaning the other person might just have a transposed
matrix.



[h20][<~Matrix Multiplication?~>]
[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/matrix_multiplicating.jpg"]


It's simple as fuck really, all you gotta do is sum the product of each
value of each row of the first matrix - with each value of each column of 
the second matrix.

But that's an unnecessarily complicated mouthful, and you'd be better off
just looking at the pictures:

[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/mat_mul1.jpg"]
[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/mat_mul2.jpg"]
[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/mat_mul3.jpg"]

Except for the sums, it really is as intuitive as multiplying a 
multidimensional array should be I figure.

There is of course the rule that you cannot multiply matrices when the first
has a number of columns non-equal to the number of rows in the second. This
isn't obvious at first, but once you try it you'll see it doesn't really make
a whole lot of sense to try and do that.


[h6][<~The Identity Matrix~>]
[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/matrix_dodge.jpg"]
Aight I'll stop with the movie pictures now.

The identity matrix is just a matrix that has it's diagonal filled with 1s.
```
1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
```^like this. Lil stairs.

An identity matrix can have any dimension as long as it's square.

This matrix has a cool property, which is the same as the 1 in regular math.
Pick any matrix and multiply by the identity matrix, and much like the 1 in
regular math, you'll end up with what you had before. There's no magic to it,
just make up some matrix with random numbers and multiply it by the 
corresponding identity matrix. If it doesn't make sense now, it will when you 
do that.



[h20][<~Representation?~>]

In graphics, 4x4 matrices are used.
You by now are aware though, that it is impossible to multiply a 1x3 matrix by 
a 4x4 matrix.

None of this makes sense yet, but points in 3D space (or vectors) are 
represented by a 1x4 or 4x1 matrix (depending on the implementation).

And so you might go and backtrace the logic. You might leave yourself wondering
"so I need fucking 4 values to multiply by some 4x4 matrix idk what the fuck it 
even does what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck".
Worry not.



[h20][<~Rotation?~>]

I'll be honest, I don't 100% know how this works, but I also don't wanna find out.
Even for the sake of writing a blog post.

It probably goes something like this: 
If you want to rotate (0, 1) around (0, 0) clockwise, all you gotta do is 
``(sin(ang), cos(ang))``
Then you just change ang, and it'll give you the point rotated by ang, always 1 
unit away from (0, 0).

That's fairly straight forward if you look at the sine/cosine graphs.
I imagine the rotation matrices are just some adaptation of that for 3 dimensions.
I have to imagine because I'm too lazy to brab a piece of paper and derive the
matrices myself, but I also imagine someone less lazy such as an interested reader
could do it with a fair amount of ease if they so desired.

[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/rot_matrices.jpg"]
You can also multiply these matrices by eachother to get a rotation for all 3 axis:
[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/rot_matrices_multiplied.jpg"]

So yeah, this is what you use to rotate points about.
Keep in mind this only ever rotates anything around (0, 0, 0), and it has to
be coupled with other [__ITALIAN][<~things~>] in order to do fancy stuff.

You may also notice this is a 3x3 matrix and start to wonder TRIST WHAT THE F-



[h20][<~Translation?~>]
This is not the main reason we use a 4x4 matrix.
It is one of the main reasons.
[h1][<~Get it? Cuz it being one of the main reason doesn't mean it's actually the main reason haha I need sleep.~>]

I think it can be pretty easily explained with a picture such as this:
[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/translation_matrix.jpg"]

So assuming the 4th parameter of our vector is always 1, each value on this row 
will just be added to each coordinate of our product vector.

So for instance:
```
[ 1 1 1 1 ] x [ 1 0 0 0 ] = [ 4 5 6 1 ]
              [ 0 1 0 0 ]
              [ 0 0 1 0 ]
              [ 3 4 5 1 ]
```And that's pretty straight forward and handy.

So now we have 1 reason why the 4x4 matrix is necessary. We can now represent the 
rotation, as well as a translation both in the same matrix. 

Also due to the fact that matrix multiplication isn't commutative (you can't change 
the order of the "parameters"), we can either apply the translation in relation to 
the "world" (an absolute transformation), or apply the transformation vector after 
it's been rotated by the rotation matrix, based on the order with which we multiply 
the two matrices.

There may also be some confusion, the previous referred rotation matrix wasn't 
actually 3x3, it was 4x4, but the extra row and column are that of an identity
matrix so the last row/column of whatever's multiplied by it remains the same.



[h20][<~Projection?~>]
Projection is the process of putting the little triangles running around your 3D
scene all into a convenient box so the rasterizer can do it's job.

[h6][<~Perspective vs Orthographic~>]
[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/perspective_vs_projection.jpg"]
That's essentially it. With an orthographic projection there's no sense
of depth. Something 100000 miles away will look as close as something 
that's in your face.


[h6][<~Clipping Planes~>]

Remember earlier when I said the Z coordinate would end up representing depth?
I also said then that it would have to be up within the range of -1 to 1 for the
rasterizer to be able to play with it.

So unfortunately, you always need to have far and near clipping planes. You may feel
tempted (as I was) to set it to -Infinity and +Infinity. But think about it, if you 
try to map a digit on an infinite range to a finite range, how could that possibly 
work? It's always going to be zero. Any_number divided by infinity is (for all intents 
and purposes) 0. So then you lose the ability to tell depth.

When you lose the ability to tell depth, your rasterizer can no longer tell what's in 
front of what, and shit'll get nasty.

Note: one of the things you do in cheats to get wallhacks is disable depth on the 
models of the players. They'll then show on top of walls as if there weren't walls 
in front of them.
[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/chams.jpg"]
In this one there's a green/blue tint applied to the models also.

The clipping planes are then used to dictate what gets to be rasterized and what doesn't
Any part of a triangle outside the clipping box (-1, -1, -1) to (1, 1, 1) isn't 
rasterized at all. So there are clipping planes in the sides, top and bottom as well, 
they just aren't talked about as much because you already can't see to the left of your
camera anyway.


[h6][<~Clipping space (and others)~>]
So first, your vertices just exist in 3D space. That's called "object space", and that's
when the positions of the vertices of your geometry are not altered. So your player model
for instance might still have his center of gravity or middle of his feet at (0, 0, 0).

You may then do rotations/transformations/scaling on those vertices if they belong to say
a model. After you've done those operations, you're in what's called "world space". It's
where your objects are moved to where you want them to be in the world.

Next, and because there is no such thing as a camera (as mentioned before, there is only
a box, and only stuff that's in it gets rendered). You have camera space. Seems a little
counter-intuitive right? It's simple. You rotate [__BOLD][<~everything~>] the opposite way 
your abstract camera would be rotated.
Think about it, when you have a phone, and you move it to the left, everything in the
picture that's displayed shifts to the right. Here, it is as if there was never a phone,
and existance itself shifted to the right because you desired to observe something that's
on the left. I presented it a bit dramatic, but it's a cool and mindblowing realization.
So now you're in camera space.

And now, you want to put everything you're looking at inside this (-1, -1, -1) to (1, 1, 1)
box, so the rasterizer can turn it into pixels. You do that with a projection matrix, and 
after that, you're finally in clip space. Where everything that is to be rendered is inside
the box.


[h20][<~Projection.~>]
[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/projector_retro.jpg"]


[h6][<~Ortographic Projection~>]

This one is the simplest. Functions to generate ortographic matrices often have 6 
parameters. Left, right, top, bottom, front, back. You can think of this as a new
clip space really.

Since we have to just convert whatever we have into the little box, then it should
be enough to just map the values.

Mapping values is easy enough, all you need is a sum and a multiplication.
So mapping the range 40<->300 to -1<->1:
``map(value) = (value-40)/((300-40)/2) - 1``
This function will map 40 to -1 and 300 to 1. It is basically the reverse of linear
interpolation.

So all we gotta do is just adapt it to make the sum independent from the
multiplication:
``value/(range/2) - range_start/(range/2)``

And we have our orthographic projection matrix:
[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/ortho_matrix.jpg"]
(this matrix is transposed relative to how I'm representing it)

And boom, we have ourselves a projection without distance perception. This isn't
always bad mind you, it can be very useful for 3D modeling, since we might want to
know that something close is perfectly aligned with something far away.

It can also look good as the styling of a 2.5D game (the version on the right):
[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/pers_ortho_game.jpg"]

But now we want the one on the left.


[h6][<~Perspective Projection~>]

This one has an ace up it's sleeve. You'll see later.

The concept is simple, really. You just want to make what's further away smaller.
That's how the world works. How your eyes and your brain, and cameras work at least.

[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/railroad.jpg"]

Notice how everything that goes away from the camera eventually ends up at the center
of the picture.
Did you think the fact that our clip space was from -1 to 1 was an accident?
Think again! 
Zero is at the center. 
And now you're thinking "yeah dickhead big deal". I am in fact a dickhead, and it is 
in fact a big deal. I bet you've noticed what happens when you divide any number by 
any other (non-fractionary) number right? It gets smaller. And smaller. And smaller
the bigger the divisor gets. It tends to 0 when the divisor tends to infinity.

Do you remember how I said Z was depth? 

Aigh I'm done with the suspence you divide X and Y by Z. The bigger Z gets the closer
X and Y will be to 0, giving you the illusion of depth.

It's all very simple maths bro.

Now the problem is you can't divide by other elements with matrix multiplication.
I spent some time and some pencil trying to figure this out. I really really tried to
get a matrix multiplication to have one element of the vector divided by the other.
You can try too, but you won't reach a solution because there isn't one.

So how do we do this?

Remember how our vectors had 4 elements despite only representing 3D space?
Well, after spending 2 hours googling shit, I figured out that that last coordinate
isn't always 1. Guess what, if it's not 1, by the time it reaches the rasterizer, the
whole vector is W normalized. 

What does that mean? XYZW. The last coordinate is called W, and once you W-normalize
the vector, it goes back to 1.
How do you make any number become 1? You divide it by itself. And then you've got 1.
Keep in mind this doesn't work with 0, but we don't care cuz in our scenario it won't
get to that.

So W-normalizing the vector is just making it (x/w, y/w, z/w, w/w). BOOM, we've got
a division.

So what next? We wanted to divide X and Y by Z, not W, what the hell?
Well my friend it is very simple:
```
1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 1
0 0 0 0
```Boom, now W is Z.

We still have a problem now. We lose our Z.
Our Z becomes Z/W, and since W is also Z, Z becomes 1.
So we must find a way to preserve our Z, otherwise the rasterizer won't have depth info.

The way I did it was I invited the clipping planes to the party, and just developed an 
equation to get me what I want.

Think of the Z alone:
```
a 0 0 0
0 b 0 0
0 0 c d
0 0 e 0
```So ``a`` and ``b`` don't matter to Z.
And if you do it in your head (or on a piece of paper), you'll arrive at the fact that
Z is actually ``(Z*c+e)/(Z*d)``.

Now all we need to do is add 2 variables: N for near plane and F for far plane, and make
sure that given ``c``, ``d``, and ``e``, they respectively map to -1 and +1.

This can be done with the following equations:
``(N*c+e)/(N*d) == -1`` which simplified is ``c/d + e/(N*d) = -1``
and
``(F*c+e)/(F*d) == +1`` which simplified is ``c/d + e/(F*d) = +1``

That becomes a system of equations, I'm bad at math so after failing to properly fucking
solving it on paper, I went to the internet so the internet would do it for me:
[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/equation.jpg"]

And boom, you get
``e = (d*(F+N))/(F-N)``
``c = (2*F*N*d)/(F-N)``
And ``d`` is your FOV because ``X = X/(Z*d)`` and ``Y = Y/(Z*d)``.

[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/perspective_matrix.jpg"]
(again, transposed)

As you can see it's pretty much the same thing in regards to the Z. 
They invert the Z so that the things in front of you have a 
negative Z while the ones in the back have a positive Z.

You can also see they have some shenanigans going on with the X and
Y, it seems to be that they're setting the X and Y based on some other
weird side, top and bottom clipping planes. Other people do it with the
tangent of the FOV angle, it's really up to however you want to handle it.

One last note, the final Z doesn't scale linearly as with the ortho matrix.
[img src="../Posts/Everything_Matrices/nonlinear_z.jpg"]

That's a 10 to 1000 clipping range on the Z, and as you can see, it hits 0 
on approximately 20. That's 50% of the final range for only 2% of the initial
one. That's fine I suppose for most applications. If you didn't want that
to be a problem, you could just multiply your vector by the projection matrix, 
and then just multiply Z by itself, since Z*Z/Z is Z, and also map it that
way. I haven't done that and I honestly don't know how common a practice it is,
but yeah, that's it folks.
