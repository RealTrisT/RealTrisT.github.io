[__TITLE__][<~Web: New Easier Post Loader~>]

[h20][<~Why~>]

For the sake of simplicity.
For 1, if I ever wanna change, say the navbar, and I have 100 posts, as it was I'd have to go and change the html for each and every one of them.
This way, I change 1 page, it changes for all posts.



[h20][<~What~>]

Basically I made it so the posts are stored with the formatting I use to write them.
The post will be chosen through the url.
The url will be then converted to Posts/[URL_POST]/index.txt, and an ajax request will be made.
The Formatting will be parsed, and it'll be gucc1.

One of the biggest advantages is that I can write along, and to preview, all I gotta do is refresh the page.


[h20][<~Example~>]

The file tree (the html ones are the old, and will be updated to this new format):
[img src="https://imgur.com/q0nX7Sp.png"]

Which would look something like:
[img src="https://imgur.com/9poYzur.png"]

Then the url would be ``realtrist.github.io/Blog/Post/?w=NewPostFormat``.

And basically, ``/Post`` will load index.txt, parse it, and boom, bootifull blog post you're currently reading.
